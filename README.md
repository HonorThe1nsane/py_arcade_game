# Overview

This is the bones and structures of a platforming game I am currently developing
I wanted to start with a simple game that supports user input and interaction
with one item in the level.

# Development Environment

I used the Arcade framework with their library of assests
I used Python as the language and VScode for my IDE
I used Tiled for my map editor

# Future Work

* Either create my own character object or partner with an artists to create a new character
* Move the camera out a little bit more to have a better look
* Create movement animation with my character
* I also want to develop a full game with mutliple characters and levels
* Need to fix camera position and create a bigger map for this level
